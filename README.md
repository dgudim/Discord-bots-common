# Discord_bots-common

This is a core library for my discord bots

it's not on npm but you can install it with
```ruby
npm install github:dgudim/Discord_bots-common
```
## Contents
  1. A simple logger with colorization support
  2. Utilities for starting your bot (`testEnvironmentVar`, `getEnvironmentVar`, `dkrInit` and `getClient`) 
  3. Message and interaction utilities (sending, replying to messages, channel, guild, user toString functions)
  4. Other utilities (`getDateTime`, `secondsToDhms`, `stripUrlScheme`, `fetchUrl`, etc.)
